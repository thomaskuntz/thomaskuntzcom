# Hello, World!

Welcome to my corner of the internet. After years of a bare-bones HTML page, I've finally built something proper — a personal site powered by **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**, with a blog system that reads from plain markdown files.

## Why a Blog?

I've always believed that writing is one of the best ways to learn. Whether it's documenting a tricky debugging session, exploring a new technology, or reflecting on lessons from managing engineering teams — putting thoughts into words forces clarity.

## The Stack

Here's what's running under the hood:

- **Vite** — lightning-fast dev server and build tool
- **React** with **React Router** — SPA with clean URLs
- **TailwindCSS v4** — utility-first CSS with a custom wizard theme
- **react-markdown** — rendering blog posts from `.md` files
- **GitHub Pages** — free hosting with custom domain

## A Quick Code Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the blog.`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

- Software engineering management
- Full-stack development tips
- Interesting problems and how I solved them
- Tools and workflows I find useful

Stay tuned, and thanks for stopping by!
